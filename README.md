# Generative-Sequential-Model
Generative models based on latent random variables are popular for time series forecasting. Generative models include the Hidden Markov Model, the Recurrent Neural Network, and the Stochastic Recurrent Neural Network. In this paper, we exploit the Pairwise Markov Models, a generalization of Hidden Markov models, as generative models. We present a parameter estimation algorithm for general Pairwise Markov Models based on Bayesian variational approaches. Simulations are presented and support our statements.
